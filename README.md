### Example Usage
#### Here's an example of how to use the useTemporal hook in a React component:


```jsx
npm install temporal-react-hook
```

Use the hook in a component:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useTemporal } from 'temporal-react-hook';

const App: React.FC = () => {
const now = useTemporal();

return (
<div>
<h1>Current Date and Time</h1>
<p>{now.toString()}</p>
</div>
);
};

export default App;
```
### Benefits

- __Accuracy__: Temporal API provides nanosecond precision and handles time zones and calendar systems better than the traditional Date object.
- __Simplicity__: The hook abstracts the complexity of handling real-time updates, making it easy to display current date and time in your React application.
- __Immutable__: Temporal objects are immutable, ensuring that each update generates a new instance without modifying the original object.

### Potential Use Cases
- __Clock Display__: Displaying a real-time clock in your application.
- __Time-based Events__: Triggering actions or displaying messages based on the current time.
- __Logging and Monitoring__: Showing timestamps for logs or monitoring data in real-time applications.
